          <img class="abdominalEx-img" src="images/abdominalEx.webp" alt="yoga-ex1">
          <p>Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Take a deep breath in through your nose, allowing diaphragm to inflate with enough air to create a slight stretching sensation in your lungs. Slowly exhale.Using this breathing technique can help reduce your heart rate and blood pressure.</p>

          <h3>4-7-8 Breathing or “relaxing breath”</h3>
          <img class="relaxingBreath-img" src="images/relaxingBreath.webp" alt="yoga-ex2">
<p>Begin by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position. Press the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, slightly open your mouth, and exhale until you reach the bottom of your breath.
Close your mouth and quietly inhale through your nose for 4 counts. Then hold your breath for 7 counts. Finally, exhale very slowly.</p>

          <h3>Progressive muscle relaxation</h3>
          <img class="abdominalEx-img" src="images/muscleRelaxation.webp" alt="yoga-ex1">
          <p>Close your eyes and focus on tensing and relaxing each muscle group for 2 to 3 seconds. Start with your feet and toes, and then move up to your knees, thighs, glutes, chest, arms, hands, neck, jaw, and eyes. Maintain deep, slow breaths the entire time.
Having trouble staying on track? Psychologist and anxiety and panic specialist suggests inhaling through your nose, holding for 5 counts while tensing your muscles, and then exhaling through your mouth as you release those muscles.
If holding your breath ever feels uncomfortable, tone it down to just a few seconds.</p>
